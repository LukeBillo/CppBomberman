# C++ Bomberman Project

This is the a recreation of Bomberman using C++ which was done for educational purposes. 
It was a part of my C++ programming module at Nottingham Trent University, and I have uploaded it for the purpose of allowing others to see my work.

The game was coded using a set of libraries such as SDL and XInput to allow me to use graphics and Xbox controllers in the game.
It's be worth noting that the game won't start unless you already have at least one Xbox 360 Controller connected, as I did not have time to create a main menu.
